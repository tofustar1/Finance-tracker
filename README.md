# Finance Tracker App :moneybag:

### Description :scroll:

This application is a financial tracker that allows users to manage their expenses and incomes. The app utilizes two main entities: transaction and category. Users have the ability to perform all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for both categories and transactions.

Here's a brief description of its functionality:

1. Categories:

- Users can create categories for incomes and expenses. Each category has a name and a type, which can be "income" or "expense".
- On the categories page, users see a list of all categories.
- Each category displays its name and type.

2. Transactions:

- Users can add transactions by selecting a category and specifying the transaction amount.
- Transactions can be either incomes or expenses, depending on the selected category.
- On the transactions page, users see a list of all their transactions, sorted by date.
- Each transaction displays the category, amount, and date.
- Additionally, on the transactions page, users see the current balance, which is calculated as the difference between the total income and total expenses.
- The balance is automatically updated when new transactions are added.

Such an application can be a useful tool for tracking finances and managing personal budgets. It helps users make more informed decisions about their finances and provides an overview of their incomes and expenses.
